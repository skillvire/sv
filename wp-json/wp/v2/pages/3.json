This service is specially designed for students who have difficulty researching by themselves &amp; who need constant support along with learning. With our professional &amp; experienced guidance, you can complete your project in time with the required standards. Whether it is a research proposal or a synopsis, a term paper or an assignment, a dissertation or a thesis, a research paper or a conference presentation, we help students in research planning, assist them in data analysis (qualitative or quantitative), and guide them in the documentation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">We believe in empowering students so, we help, guide, &amp; assist (the way how the real guide works). We help in domain selection, research type selection, variable selection, sample design, topic, and methodology formulation. We provide access to the limited access research papers and psychological tools, and we also help in the data analysis. We guide in framing the introduction, rationale, research gaps, results, discussions, references, etc. for a publication-fit manuscript. Slots for the research guidance services are limited but sufficient. You can take advantage of our free basic-level guidance about how to initiate\/ carry out research in psychology by&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/sv\/contact\">contacting&nbsp;<\/a>us. The charges for the research solutions are based on per research\/ project\/ service (with any number of authors) basis. Group discounts may or may not be available for any of the services. Any research project which is left abandoned for more than 10 months would lead to service termination.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>REFUND POLICY<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Once applied for any service, payment is only fully refunded if the service is canceled by us or not fully delivered. If the client decides to end the service at any point between their payment &amp; service completion, we refund the money after a 50% deduction. There is no refund once the service ends. Payments done on the wrong account are not considered valid for the service. There are no refunds in cases like false information, forgery, faking, &amp; all others. If a research project is left abandoned for more than 10 months then the service would be terminated with no refund.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>DATA<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">At SKILLVIRE, we do not collect or store any personal information until the visitor applies for any service.
